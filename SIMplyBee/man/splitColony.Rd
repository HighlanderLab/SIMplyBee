\title{Split colony in two colonies}
\usage{
splitColony(colony, p = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{\code{\link{Colony-class}}}

\item{p}{numeric, proportion of workers that will go to the split colony}
}
\value{
list with two \code{\link{Colony-class}}, the \code{split} and the
  \code{remnant} (see the description what each colony holds!); both colonies
  have the split even slot set do \code{TRUE}
}
\description{
Level 2 function that splits colony into two new colonies to
  prevent swarming (in managed situation). The remnant colony retains the
  queen and a proportion of the workers and all drones. The split colony gets
  the other part of the workers and keeps location of the original colony.
