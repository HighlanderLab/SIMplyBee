Description: SIMplyBee is an extension of the AlphaSimR package
  (https://cran.r-project.org/package=AlphaSimR) for stochastic simulations of
  honeybee populations and breeding programmes. It enables simulation of
  individual bees that form a colony, which includes a queen, fathers (drones
  the queen mated with), virgin queens, workers, and drones. Multiple colony can
  be merged into a population of colonies, such as an apiary or whole country of
  colonies. Functions enable operations on castes, colony, or colonies, to ease
  R scripting of whole populations. All AlphaSimR functionality with respect to
  genomes and genetic and phenotype values is available and further extended for
  honeybees, including haplo-diploidy, csd locus, colony events (swarming,
  supersedure, etc.) and colony phenotype values.
