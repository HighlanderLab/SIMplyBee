\title{Pulls drone groups from a Drone Congregation Area (DCA)}
\usage{
pullDroneGroupsFromDCA(DCA, nGroup, avgGroupSize = 17)
}
\arguments{
\item{DCA}{\code{\link{Pop-class}}, population of drones}

\item{nGroup}{integer, number of drone groups to be created}

\item{avgGroupSize}{numeric, average number of drones per group}
}
\value{
list of \code{\link{Pop-class}}
}
\description{
Level 1 function that pulls drone groups from a Drone
  Congregation Area (DCA) to use them later in mating. Number of drones per
  group is sampled from a truncated Poisson distribution parameterised with
  an average group size and truncation at zero (= zeroes are excluded).
  Drones are pulled (removed) from the DCA to reflect the fact that drones
  die after mating, so they can't be present in the DCA anymore.
