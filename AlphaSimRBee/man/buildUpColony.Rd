\usage{
\method{buildUpColony}(colony, nWorkers, nDrones)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{AlphaSimRBee Colony object}

\item{nWorkers}{Desired number of workers wanted in the colony}

\item{nDrones}{Desired number of drones wanted in the colony}
}
\value{
Updated AlphaSimRBee Colony object
}
\description{
Workers and drones are added to a colony/colonies to build it/them
up to the number of desired workers and drones (nWorkers and nDrones).
A user would want to build up a colony in the Period 1 and if events such as split or swarming
occur.

#Create founder haplotypes
founderPop = quickHaplo(nInd=200, nChr=1, segSites=10)

#Set simulation parameters
SP = SimParam$new(founderPop)

#Create population
base = newPop(founderPop, simParam=SP)

#Create 10 mated colonies from the base population
apiary1 = createMultipleMatedColonies(base, nColonies = 10, nAvgFathers = 15)

#Build-up the colonies
colonyFullSize = 500
apiary1 = buildUpColonies(apiary1, nWorkers = colonyFullSize, nDrones = colonyFullSize * 0.1)
