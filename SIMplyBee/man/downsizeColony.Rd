\title{Reduce number of workers and remove all drones and virgin queens from hive}
\usage{
downsizeColony(colony, p = 0.85, use = "rand", new = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{\code{\link{Colony-class}}}

\item{p}{numeric, percentage of workers to remove from the colony (Seeley, 2019)}

\item{use}{character, all the options provided by \code{\link{selectInd}};
it guides the selection of workers that will be removed}

\item{new}{logical, should we remove all current workers and add a targeted
proportion anew (say, create winter workers)}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Colony-class}} with workers reduced and drones/virgin queens removed
}
\description{
Level 2 function that downsizes colony by removing a percentage of
  workers, all drones and all virgin queens.  Usually in the autumn, such an event occurs
  in preparation for the winter months.
