\title{Replaces a proportion workers with new workers with new genetic information}
\usage{
\method{replaceWorkers}(colony, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{AlphaSimRBee Colony object.}

\item{p}{Numeric, proportion of workers to be replaced with new ones.}
}
\value{
Updated AlphaSimRBee Colony object
}
\description{
Replace a proportion of workers in the new with new workers from the same queen and same fathers.
A user would want to replace a proportion (or all) of workers after swarming and supersedure or
due to the short-life span of the workers.

\examples{
#Create founder haplotypes
founderPop <- quickHaplo(nInd=200, nChr=1, segSites=10)

#Set simulation parameters
SP <- SimParam$new(founderPop)

#Create population
pop <- newPop(founderPop, simParam=SP)

#Creates colony
colony1 <- createColony(queen = base[1], fathers = base[2:15])
colony1 <- addWorkers(colony1, nInd = 2000)
colony1 <- replaceWorkers(colony1, p = 0.2)
