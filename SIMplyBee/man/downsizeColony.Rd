\title{Reduce number of workers and remove all drones and virgin queens from hive}
\usage{
downsizeColony(colony, p = NULL, use = "rand", new = FALSE, simParamBee = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{colony}{\code{\link{Colony-class}}}

\item{p}{numeric, percentage of workers to be removed from the colony; if
\code{NULL} then \code{SimParamBee$pDownsize} is used}

\item{use}{character, all the options provided by \code{\link{selectInd}};
it guides the selection of workers that will be removed}

\item{new}{logical, should we remove all current workers and add a targeted
proportion anew (say, create winter workers)}

\item{simParamBee}{\code{\link{SimParamBee}}, global simulation parameters}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Colony-class}} with workers reduced and drones/virgin queens removed
}
\description{
Level 2 function that downsizes colony by removing a percentage
  of workers, all drones and all virgin queens. Usually in the autumn, such
  an event occurs in preparation for the winter months.
