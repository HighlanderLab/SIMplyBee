\title{Report which colony events have occurred}
\usage{
getEvents(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{Colony-class}} or \code{\link{Colonies-class}}}
}
\value{
matrix of logicals, named by colony id when \code{x} is
  \code{\link{Colonies-class}}
}
\description{
Level 0 function that returns a matrix of logicals reporting the
  status of the colony events. The events are: split, swarm, supersedure,
  collapse, and production. These events impact colony status, strength, and
  could also impact downstream phenotypes.
