In SIMplyBee, when we modify an object, we return it following  R's functional style of programming. However, we do not return drone-donor colonies when sampling the drones for mating and crossing the virgin queens. A virgin queen can mate with several ($n$) drones, which die during  mating. To reflect reality, the drone sampling or the crossing function should return $n$ updated colonies with the drones removed, which could be computationally inefficient. Instead, when the drones mate, we change their caste in the \texttt{SimParamBee} from drones to fathers, which marks them as mated and dead.
